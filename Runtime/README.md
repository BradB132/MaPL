# MaPL Runtime

The goal of the MaPL runtime is to have a small amount of code that executes MaPL bytecode efficiently, and provides a clear API for interaction with the host program. Files that are needed to build the runtime are:

* `./Headers/MaPLRuntime.h`
* `./MaPLRuntime/MaPLRuntime.c`
* `../Shared/Headers/MaPLTypedefs.h`
